# Obsidian Syncthing Launcher

Obsidian plugin designed to run Syncthing synchronization software directly as a subprocess of Obsidian, providing a convenient solution for users who prefer not to install Syncthing as a standalone application. 

## 🚀 Features
- Embedded Syncthing executable: No separate installation required! The Syncthing integrated within the plugin.
- Syncthing running status: Status indicator located in the bottom-right status bar of Obsidian. The status is represented as:
  - 🔵 Syncthing Running: Indicates that Syncthing is actively running and your files are being synced.
  - ⚫ Syncthing Not Running: Indicates that Syncthing is currently not active.
- Last Sync Timestamp: Time of the last successful synchronization directly within the status bar.
- Automatic Syncthing start and close: Syncthing is started on Obsidian open and closed on its close.
